# DOCUMENTATION
    I have edited the authpage only.
    --The login and signup fetch and post data from the postgres database on render.
    --I used axios to make it easier.

# Note
    You can't add subscriptions yet since the user data is relying on the new database so adding subscriptions will rely on the new db too.
